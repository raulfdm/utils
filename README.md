> A collection of utils I have to write all the time and I'm tired to reimplement it.

## List

 - [simple-id](packages/simple-id/): Very simple function to generate unique (and short max 10 length) ID.
 - [decimal-counter](packages/decimal-counter/): Tiny implementation to check how many decimal places has your number.
